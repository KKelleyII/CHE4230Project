# College Basketball - March Madness Predictive Model

## Overview
This project predicts win probabilities for college basketball games using supervised learning techniques. Additionally, it explores unsupervised learning to identify useful features that enhance prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Win Probability Model**: Uses supervised learning to predict game outcomes.
- **Feature Discovery**: Applies unsupervised learning to identify meaningful patterns in data.
- **CSV Export**: Saves scraped data in CSV format for analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Prediction Model
1. Obtain Game data by visiting kenpom.com/cbbga(yy).txt
   - save file as csv, can be done by saving as a text file then changing ".txt" to ".csv" in file explorer
   - There is an xlsx reader in the file list if you just want to paste it into a cell
     
2. Run Compiler code to reformat the .csv to a clean version with proper columns for the dates/teams/scores
   - make sure to update filepaths for the input and output
     
3. Obtain Team Data:
   - I have not found a webscraping ability to automate this yet
   - To do this, visit "https://kenpom.com/archive.php?d=yyyy-mm-dd" to get the offensive and defensive ratings for each day you want to do analysis on
   - Right now the best method is to just copy and paste the table with the data and throw it into an excel. I have an example excel as "Kenpom Data"
   - Next you refill down the cells in "February Results NI" Worksheet after putting more games in, do the same for the "February Results I" sheet
   - copy the "February Results I" sheet and paste "Values", then save as a .csv. This will be the file your unsupervised and supervised learning will read.

4. Unsupervised Learning:
   -Use ProjectUSLM
     
5. Supervised Learning:
   -Use SLRegressionModel
6. March Madness Bracket
